# Divisor Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Divisor!

Divisor is a Python-based tool that automates the creation of a Jekyll-powered website from an existing Git repository that keeps a backup of a wiki.js powered website.

## How it works

The first basic step is to fetch the contents from the source repository. Then, the tool will generate a Jekyll website based on the configuration file `config.yml`. The generated website will be placed in the `destination_folder` defined in the configuration file.

The `config.yml` file allows you to customize the generated website. You can define the site's title, description, theme, and other options. You can also map specific files and folders from your source repository to the generated website.

## Configuration

The main configuration file is `config.yml`. Here's a breakdown of the available options:

```yaml
site_metadata:
  title: "My Awesome Website"
  description: "A website generated by Divisor."
  theme: "minima"
  github_pages_url: "https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>"
  about_page_title: "About this site"
  about_page_body: "This is a sample description paragraph."

source_repository: "https://github.com/fonte-wiki/Backup-fonte-wiki"

content_mapping:
  home_page_source: "home.md"
  subpages_folder: "pages"
  destination_folder: "site_contents"
  media_destination_folder: "assets/media"

license: "CC-BY"
```

### `site_metadata`

*   `title`: The title of your website.
*   `description`: A short description of your website.
*   `theme`: The Jekyll theme to use. Defaults to "minima".
*   `github_pages_url`: The URL of your GitHub Pages website.
*   `about_page_title`: The title of the "About" page.
*   `about_page_body`: The content of the "About" page.

### `source_repository`

The URL of the Git repository to use as the source for your website's content.

### `content_mapping`

*   `home_page_source`: The path to the Markdown file to use as the home page.
*   `subpages_folder`: The path to the folder containing the subpages. This field is optional. If you don't want to include any subpages, you can remove this line from the configuration file.
*   `destination_folder`: The folder where the generated Jekyll site will be created.
*   `media_destination_folder`: The folder where the media files will be copied.

### `license`

The license for your website's content. If you are using the default source repository, you should give proper attribution to the fonte.wiki website.

## Usage

1.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Configure the website:**

    Edit the `config.yml` file to customize your website.

3.  **Generate the website:**

    ```bash
    python cli.py generate
    ```

4.  **Preview the website:**

    To preview your site locally, you'll need to have Ruby and Bundler installed. Then, `cd` into your generated site's directory and run:

    ```bash
    bundle install
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

5.  **Deploy the website:**

    To deploy the website to GitHub Pages, run:

    ```bash
    python cli.py deploy
    ```
