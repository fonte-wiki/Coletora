# Divisor

Divisor is a Python-based tool that automates the creation of a Jekyll-powered website from an existing Git repository that keeps a backup of a wiki.js powered website.

The core idea is to provide a simple and flexible way to generate a static website from selected contents, without having to manually set up a Jekyll environment or manage the content conversion process manually. The resulting website will be deployed to GitHub Pages by default.

## How it works

The first basic step is to fetch the contents from the source repository. Then, the tool will generate a Jekyll website based on the configuration file `config.yml`. The generated website will be placed in the `destination_folder` defined in the configuration file.

The `config.yml` file allows you to customize the generated website. You can define the site's title, description, theme, and other options. You can also map specific files and folders from your source repository to the generated website.

## Configuration

The main configuration file is `config.yml`. Here's a breakdown of the available options:

```yaml
site_metadata:
  title: "My Awesome Website"
  description: "A website generated by Divisor."
  theme: "minima"
  github_repository_url: "https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git"
  github_pages_url: "https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>"
  about_page_title: "About this site"
  about_page_body: "This is a sample description paragraph."

source_repository: "https://github.com/fonte-wiki/Backup-fonte-wiki"

content_mapping:
  home_page_source: "home.md"
  subpages_folder: "<none>"
  destination_folder: "site_contents"
  media_destination_folder: "assets/media"
```

### `site_metadata`

*   `title`: The title of your website.
*   `description`: A short description of your website.
*   `theme`: The Jekyll theme to use. Defaults to "minima".
*   `github_pages_url`: The URL of your GitHub Pages website.
*   `about_page_title`: The title of the "About" page.
*   `about_page_body`: The content of the "About" page.

### `source_repository`

The URL of the Git repository to use as the source for your website's content.

### `content_mapping`

*   `home_page_source`: The path to the Markdown file to use as the home page.
*   `subpages_folder`: The path to the folder containing the subpages. To disable subpages, set this field to `<none>`.
*   `destination_folder`: The folder where the generated Jekyll site will be created.
*   `media_destination_folder`: The folder where the media files will be copied.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fonte-wiki/divisor.git
   cd divisor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure the website:**

   Edit the `config.yml` file to customize your website.

3. **Generate the website:**

   ```bash
   python cli.py generate
   ```

   **Note:** This command will always fetch the latest content from the source repository before generating the website.

4. **Preview the website:**

   To preview your site locally, you'll need to have Ruby and Bundler installed. Then, `cd` into your generated site's directory and run:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

5. **Deploy the website:**

   To deploy the website to GitHub Pages, run:

   ```bash
   python cli.py deploy
   ```

   The destination repository is configured in the `config.yml` file via the `github_repository_url` field.

## GitHub Pages Setup

To deploy your website to GitHub Pages, you need to configure your repository correctly.

1.  **Create a `gh-pages` branch:**

    ```bash
    git checkout --orphan gh-pages
    git rm -rf .
    git commit --allow-empty -m "Initial commit"
    git push origin gh-pages
    ```

2.  **Configure GitHub Pages:**

    In your repository's settings, go to the "Pages" section and select the `gh-pages` branch as the source for your GitHub Pages site.

## Automated Workflow

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the process of generating and deploying the website. The workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file and consists of the following steps:

1.  **Scheduled Trigger:** The workflow is configured to run automatically every hour. It can also be triggered manually from the Actions tab in your GitHub repository.
2.  **Checkout and Setup:** The workflow checks out the repository, sets up the Python environment, and installs the required dependencies.
3.  **Generate Website:** It runs the `python cli.py generate` command to fetch the latest content from the source repository and generate the website.
4.  **Deploy to GitHub Pages:** Finally, it runs the `python cli.py deploy` command to deploy the generated website to the `gh-pages` branch.

### Workflow Secrets

The workflow requires the following secrets to be set in your repository's settings:

*   `GIT_USER`: The username to use for the commit.
*   `GIT_EMAIL`: The email address to use for the commit.

You can add these secrets by going to `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions` in your GitHub repository.
